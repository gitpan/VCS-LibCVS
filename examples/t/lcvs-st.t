# Test lcvs-st
#########################

# This script should be in a directory called t and should be run from the
# parent directory of that.  It will test the lcvs-st in its parent directory.
# It looks for various things under that assumption.

# The test creates a repository and sandboxes, which is fairly time intensive.
# If you want to save this time, set LCVS_ST_T_TEST_REPO_DIR to a directory
# name which you want to use.  If the directory exists it will be reused.  Be
# careful if you change the directory, or upgrade the script, because this may
# break the tests.  It's also useful if tests are failing, and you want to
# check out the contents of the repository to find out why, since it won't be
# removed.

# Please excuse the shell scripty stuff here.

DESCRIPTION

LibCVS provides access to CVS working directories and repositories.  This is
the Perl version of LibCVS.  See http://libcvs.cvshome.org.  If you are using
LibCVS please let us know, we are keen to help.

It also ships with two useful scripts: lcvs-logsummary which transforms CVS
commit logs into ChangeLog format, grouping multiple file commits into a single
entry; lcvs-st which prints out an exhaustive status of files in a working
directory.

To learn LibCVS, the script examples/lcvs-example is a good place to start.

A lot of effort has been put into the documentation, so please use perldoc.  If
something isn't clear in the docs, please report it, so we can fix it up.


MAJOR LIMITATIONS

The current version provides read-only access, it won't modify your working
directory, nor your repository.  Ways to modify them will come in later
releases when I'm more comfortable that the core is working properly.

The tests are not yet thorough.  The only tests are for the script lcvs-st.

Performance is poor.

The interface _will_ change, but changes will be detailed in this README and
the ChangeLog.  I will add and remove objects, change their names, change
function names and function signatures.


PREREQUISITES

* You will need Perl installed.  I've developed with Perl 5.6.1 and 5.8.0, but
  it will probably work with others too.

* For remote repository access, CVS is not required.  For local access it is.
  I've developed with CVS 1.10.8, 1.11.1p1, 1.11.11+ and 1.12.9+, but it will
  probably work with others too.  (http://www.cvshome.org/)


INSTALLATION

    $ ./Makefile.PL

    $ make test

    # make install

Or, possibly, use the CPAN shell:

  # perl -MCPAN -e shell
  cpan> install VCS::LibCVS
